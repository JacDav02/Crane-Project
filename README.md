This repository has all the code to run our public website, which showcases the mother-daughter bot system (MERMAIIDS) project for the 2020 SEAP internship at Crane, Indiana. It also includes a folder with all of the code we created to run the mother-daughter bot system, for archive purposes as well as to open source our material.
